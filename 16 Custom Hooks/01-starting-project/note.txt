<<< Custom Hooks >>>
- insdie of other hooks
- wrap and reuse functions inside of your component functions

- 1. sending http request
- 2. managing loading state
- 3. manaing error state

=> those functionality is almost the same and we want to create re-useable function like reusable component 


<<< How to create custom hooks >>>
1. create "hooks" folder inside of "src" folder
2. create a file e.x. useFetch.js / use-fetch.js / fetch.js
3. in the file, create a normal function - name has to be start "use" because it's a convention/ rule.
: the function start with "use" is treated as a hooks 
4. we need to import useState and useEffect 
5. create 3 states up there 
6. edit functions neutral (be careful with dependency)
7. return 3 state values 
8. export it 
9. use! => const {isFetching, fetchedData, error} = useFetch(fetchUserPlaces);


** any state we built in cutom hook will belongs to the component we are using it
