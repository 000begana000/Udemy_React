Redux & Side Effects (and Asynchronous Code)

    - Reducers must be 'pure, side-effect free, synchronous' functions
    => Never send fetch in our reducer!



    
Where should side-effects & async tasks be executed?

    => inside the 'components' (via useEffect())
    => insde the 'action creators' (we write our own)




1) Fetch data inside the components
    1. get our current cart with useSelector before it's updated
    2. do all the transfomation which is doing in reducer "without mutating state"
    3. send a request
