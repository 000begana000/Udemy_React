loader()

    1. an extra property in router and it wants a function as a value
    2. and that function will be executed by react router when we are about to visit that route(path).
    3. it execute loader() first then component.
    4. {
            index: true,
            element: <EventsPage />,
            loader: async () => {
              const response = await fetch("http://localhost:8080/events");

              if (!response.ok) {
                // we will deal with incorrect response later
              } else {
                const resData = await response.json();
                return resData.events;   <<======
              }
            },
          },
    5. react router will get the any returned values and be able to use this data at the component (in this case, EventPage)




How to use data from loader

    1. import { useLoaderData } from "react-router-dom";
    2. react dom will get promise data for us so we don't need to worry about whether loader was async function or not.
    3. const data = useLoaderData();
    4. return <EventsList events={data} />;
