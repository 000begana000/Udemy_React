What is Redux? 

- A "state management system" for "croress-component" or "app-wide" state = like useContext()




Redux vs useContext

"useContext has some potential disadvantages"
(but we can use both Redux and useContext in the same application)
- Deeply nested providers (too many providers)
- Complex providers (too much work in one provider)
- Not optimized for high-frequency changes




Core Redux Concept

- Central data (state) store
** we have ONLY ONE store for entire application **
- Components subscribe the store.
- Components NEVER directly manipulate the store data but we use Reducer function.
- Reducer function mutates(=changes) data in store. 
** it's NOT useReducer hook but general concept as like reducer method ** 
- How we trigger this reducer function? we have "Actions" and components "Dispatch" actions. (we can say component trigger actions)
- Redux forwards actions to the reducer then this operation is performed by the reducer.
- When the state is updated, subscribing components are notified, so they can update their UI.
