<< Error Boundary >>

- for ErrorBoundary it has to be a class based component

        import { Component } from "react";

        class ErrorBoundary extends Component {
        // this function is just a term for the error boundary
        componentDidCatch() {}

        render() {
            return this.props.children;
        }
        }


- wrap the component which might throw errors which we wanna handle.
- you can wrap more than 1 component.

        <ErrorBoundary>
            <Users users={filteredUsers} />
        </ErrorBoundary>
