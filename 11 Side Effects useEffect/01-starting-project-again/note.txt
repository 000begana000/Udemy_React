"useEffect" - component mounting
can be used to implement lot of features like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount, and many more. 

On the other hand, 
"useCallback" - function connected useEffect
is used for optimizing the performance by caching a function reference so that it doesn't have to be recreated on every render.
