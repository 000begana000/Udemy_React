Data Fetching & HTTP requests
:sending & receiving Data via HTTP

- how to connect a backend/ database

// How (not) to connect to a database

- with React, you build a client-side web application (= it runs in the browser)

- You communicate with a backend(API) via HTTP requests 

- You should not try to connect to a database directly (-> credentials would be exeposed)

- Frontend (React app) & backend (API) are often separated (=separate projects)

- You can build a fullstack React app (= blend frontend & backend) via NextJS or Remix
