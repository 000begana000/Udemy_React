// Managing State
- try to create state as less as possible
- don't forget to use object to store data efficiently 
- find correct title 

// Ref
- ref.current <=== must remember
- when the version of React is under 19, we need to use forwardRef
- when we forward a ref, don't forget to connect ref={ref}
