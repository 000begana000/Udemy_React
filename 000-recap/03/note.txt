// what does do React to JSX code?

React translates JSX (JavaScript XML) into regular JavaScript that browsers can understand. JSX looks like HTML inside JavaScript, making it easier to write and read UI components.

How React Handles JSX:

1. JSX is written in your code
const element = <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;

2. React converts it to JavaScript using Babel
const element = React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello, World!");

3. The browser renders it as HTML
<h1>Hello, World!</h1>

JSX is just a shortcut for writing React elements in a more readable way!
