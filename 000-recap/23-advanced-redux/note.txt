Redux deep dive
    - handling async tasks with Redux 
    - where to put your code
    - the redux DevTools


Side effects, async tasks & redux 
    - Reducers must be pure, side-effect free, synchronous functions!
        Input(old state + action) => Output(New state)
    
    - Where should side-effects & async tasks be executed?
        1. inside the components (e.g., via useEffect())
        2. inside the action creators 


npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
npm install react-redux

import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
export const uiActions = uiSlice.actions;

import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import store from "./store/index";

import { useDispatch } from "react-redux";
import { uiActions } from "../../store/ui-slice";

import { useSelector } from "react-redux";
