// What are forms & what's tricky about them?
<form submission>
- handling submission is relatively easy
- entered values can be managed via state
- alternatively, they can be extracted via refs
- or via formdata and native browser features

<input validation>
- providing a good user experience is tricky
- you can validate on every keystroke -> errors may be shown too early 
- you can validate on lost focus -> errors may be shown too long
