Using form actions
- form actions & custom submission handling
- extracting values & managing form state
- synchronous & asynchronous actions 
- optimistic UI updating

// What are form actions?
- we can use this feature from react ver.19

- instead of onSubmit attr., use action prop 
- React kind of overrides this attribute, this prop, a value to action, will be executed when the form is submitted.
- react reset the form automatically with action attr. too.

<form action={signupAction}>
// default action = define url/path to send the form data 

- with action, we will get formData, not event 
- and this formData has all the input data (this case, email)

function signupAction(formData) {
    const enteredEamil = formData.get("email");
    console.log(enteredEamil);
  }

- don't forget to create name attr. for this feature (identifier of data)

<input id="email" type="email" name="email" />
