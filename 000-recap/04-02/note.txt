// <span> Tag

<li>
    <span className="player-name">Player 1</span>
    <span className="player-symbol">X</span>
</li>

The <span> tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.
The <span> tag is much like the <div> element, but <div> is a block-level element and <span> is an inline element.

// Every custom Component has isolated instances.

// prefix input field
<input type="text" required value={name} />    ====> use value prop 

// update state based on old state must pass a function for guaranteed latest state value
(X) setIsEditing(!isEditing);
(O) setIsEditing(editing => !editing);

State update are not performed instantly but at some point in the future
(when React has time for it)

In most cases, those state updates of course still are executed almost instantly.



1. Header (Title of game)
2. 2 Players Slots - Player Components in <ol>
3. useState for Player name & Edit button (editing mode)
4. prefix input field with value property
