Working with forms & user input

- what's difficult about forms?
- handling form submission & validating user input
- using built-in form features
- building custom solutions

// What are forms & what's tricky about them?
<form submission>
- handling submission is relatively easy
- entered values can be managed via state
- alternatively, they can be extracted via refs
- or via formdata and native browser features

<input validation>
- providing a good user experience is tricky
- you can validate on every keystroke -> errors may be shown too early 
- you can validate on lost focus -> errors may be shown too long


// Handling form submission

** htmlFor = for in html and it works with id in input 
<label htmlFor="email">Email</label>

** page refreshing is happening because form tag sending http request default
=> how to prevent default ?

1. type="button" (default type is submit)
<button type="button" className="button" onClick={handleSubmit}>
    Login
</button>

2. instead of onClick, use onSubmit on <form>
<form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>

function handleSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault(); <======
    console.log("submitted!");
}
