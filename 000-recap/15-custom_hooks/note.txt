Custom hooks
- repetition: rules of hooks 
- why custom hooks?
- creating custom hooks 
- using custom hooks

// Revisitting the "rules of hooks" and why to use hooks 
: Only call hooks in Component or "other hook functions"

as other functions we can outsource the fetching function 
but we use hooks (e.x. useEffect) and state management we can't simply outsource the function - it's not guaranteed working.
=> how can we make it works?

// Creating a custom hook 

we can reuse fetch function everywhere

1. create a folder src/hooks
2. create a file useFetch.js (up to me)
3. create a normal function, starting with 'use' - it's a convention for a hook, it's recognized as a hook to react
