<<< Memo >>> => BUT!! clever component composition is the key!

it will take a look at the props of your component function
and whenever the component function would norally execute again 
for example because the app component function executes,
memo will take a look at the old prop value 
and at the new prop value that would be received now
if that component function would execute
and if those prop values are exactly the same,
which for arrays and objects mean that they really have to be exactly
the same array or object in memory
but if they are the same the component excution will be prevented by memo.

Counter => will be re-executed if initialCount prop or state change.
when it's not executed then the child components of Counter will not re-executed too.

Memo cares about exterenal changes from parent component.

!!!
DON'T OVERUSE MEMO()!
x. Use it "as high up in the component tree as possible"
-> blocking a component execution there will also block all child component executions

x. Checking props with memo() "costs performance"!
-> don't wrap it around all your components - it will just add a lot of unnecessary checks

x. Don't use it on components where "props will change frequently"
-> memo() would just perform a meaningless check in such cases (which cost performance)




<<< useCallback() >>>

used for conjunction of useEffect() but also with memo()



<<< useMemo() >>>

warpped around "NORMAL FUNCTIONS" that are executed in component functions to prevent their execution from component function cycle.
and useMemo() should really only be used if you have a complex calculation that you want to prevent.

const [counter, setCounter] = useState(initialCount);

const initialCountIsPrime = useMemo(
    () => isPrime(initialCount),
    [initialCount]
  );

useMemo() will be executed when initialCount value is changed.
but it will not executed if the counter state is changed.

Don't over use as the same reason of memo()



<<< Virtual DOM >>>

React checks for necessary DOM updates via a "Virtual DOM".
it creates & compares virtual DOM snapshots
to find out which part of the rendered UI need to be updated

step 1: creating a "Component Tree"
step 2: Creating a "Virtual Snapshot" of the Target HTML code
step 3: "Compare" New Virtual DOM Snapshot to Previous (Old) Virtual DOM Snapshot
step 4: Identify & Apply Changes to the "Real DOM"
step 5: repeat the same steps from 1
(after first function cycle and when we click something, React will find out what part of tree has changed and checks such as useMemo())



<<< key Prop >>>

1. It's important to let React know which "specific item" to update
2. whenever key value changes, React will throw away the old component instance and re-create it.

=> we should use it if we have some state change in parent component 
that should then lead to some child component being reset.



<<< 2 state updating functions in a one function >>>

function handleSetCount(newCount) {
  setChosenCount(newCount);
  setChosenCount(prevState => prevState + 1);
}

it will not render the component twice but they are batched together and will only lead to one component function execution.
