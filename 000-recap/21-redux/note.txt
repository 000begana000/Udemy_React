- what is redux? and why would you use it?
- redux basics & using redux with react
- working with redux toolkit


- what is redux?
: A state management system for cross-component or app-wide state 
    React : useState & useReducer - update UI


- what is cross-component & app-wide state?
    1. local state : state belongs to a single component 
    
    e.g., listening to user input on input field or toggling a "show more details" field 

    !!!should be managed inside the component via useState() or useReducer()


    2. cross-component state : state affecting multiple components 

    e.g., open/ closed state of a modal overlay

    !!!requires "prop drilling"
    => react Context or Redux


    3. app-wide state : state affecting the entire app

    e.g., user authentication status or chosen theme

    !!!requires "prop drilling"
    => react Context or Redux


- Redux vs React Context 
: react context has some potential disadvantages 

    1. complex setup & management 
        in more complex apps, using Context can lead to deeply nested or "fat" "Context Provider" components 

    2. performance 
        Context is not optimized for high-frequency state changes 


- How redux works : core redux concept 

    1. central data (state) store 
        : we have only 1 store for entire application
    
    2. component subscribe central data
        : when data changes the central store notify component 
    
    3. component NEVER directly manipulate store data
        : instead we run reducer function and this function mutates (=changes) data in store 
        ===> it's not useReducer(). reducer functions are a general concept
    
    4. we trigger(dispatch) actions 
        : redux forward that action to reducer and perform the operation

    component dispatches action and action forward action to reducer then reducer does what action orders finally reducer spits out a new state which affects central store then the components get notified and then update UI
