// Strict mode
it will execute every component function twice instead of once and it does that during development mode only.
when every components gets executed twice, it helps you catch errors.
we can use it anywhere, not only for App component but only a single component is possible

import
import { StrictMode } from 'react';

wrap the App component
ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(<StrictMode><App /></StrictMode>);
