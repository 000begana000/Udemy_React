<<< How to connect a backand / database >>>

- Front-end
With React, you build a "client-side" web application (it runs in browser)

- HTTP Request
You communicate with backend (API) via "HTTP Requests"

- Back-end (REST) API
A web server exposes certain "endpoint" (URLs) to which you can send requests & data (to receive data back)

***
API stands for "Application Programming Interface"
A REST API is a web server that exposes certain pre-defined routes to which HTTP Requests can be sent.

===> You should NOT try to CONNECT TO A DATABASE directly(-> credentials would be exposed)

Front-end(React) and Back-end(API) are "often separated"(=separate projects)

Front-end(React, JS)
Back-end(JS, C#, Java, PHP ...)

===> You can build Full-stack React app (=blend front-end & back-end) via NextJS or Remix
